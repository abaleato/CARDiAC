# CARDiAC

Code for Anisotropic Redshift Distributions in Angular Clustering

# Installation
Prerequisites
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pickle`
- `astropy`
- `healpy`
- `camb`, `anzu` (though the user could replace them with their own power spectra)
- `numba` for JIT compilation of galaxy lensing kernels, which are slow to compute otherwise
- `multiprocessing`, though this is typically not needed

# Usage
More will come here, but for now see `Tutorial.ipynb`.
